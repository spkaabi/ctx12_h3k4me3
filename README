these are re-sequenced versions of Ale's CTX data.  These are Ctx12 (undifferntiated), BMP4 & FBS Astro (day 3 differentiation) and with H3K4me3 ChIP or corresponding input.  The original files appeared as if samples had been mixed up and so were re-run.

These are the data that came on DVDs in June 2011 from Irene at GIS.

According to the GIS excel spreadsheet the codes are as follow:

CMN046 is BMP4 Astro H3K4me3
CMN047 is BMP4 Astro input
CMN048 is FBS Astro H3K4me3
CMN049 is FBS Astro input
CMN050 is Ctx12 H3K4me3
CMN051 is Ctx12 input
